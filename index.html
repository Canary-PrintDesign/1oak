After starting his woodworking career in 1993, he received the Canadian equivalent of Red Seal Journeyman Tickets in both Carpentry and Joinery (cabinetry & furniture building). <br> He continued his woodworking education to achieve the German Masters degree in joinery, allowing him to provide high quality design, drafting, and production in all of your woodwork projects. <br><br> </p> <h4 class=text-center>His work embodies the well-known German 'attention to detail'</h4> <img class=img-responsive src=images/fa65f051.fireplace.jpg> <br><br><br> <p>Wolf owned and operated a profitable business in Germany for many years before he moved to Canada in 2007, when he started working in the commercial cabinetry industry. <strong>**Why move to Canada maybe?**</strong> <br> During his years in the commercial industry, he realized the need for a shop like 1oak – where custom cabinetry meets design in perfect harmony. <br> In 2011 Wolf moved to Nanoose Bay, BC and started the operation of 1oak. <br><br> His extensive training allows him to work with his clients to assess their needs, budget, and ideal vision - and implement the drafting, design and creation of custom cabinetry, furniture and interior construction and decoration. <strong>**consider revising**</strong> <br><br> The main passion at 1oak is on kitchens, bathrooms and unique solitary furniture but includes multi-trade renovation and interior projects as well. <strong>**Consider revising first part**</strong> <br><br> <blockquote><span>Everything we do is custom! We do it all in-house - from the design process to the finished product! There are no limitations.
